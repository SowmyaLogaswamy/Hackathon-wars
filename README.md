# Hackathon-War

#### _JavaScript - Week4 independent project in Angular2, 08/18/2017_

#### By _**Sowmya Devi Logaswamy**_

## Description

Hackathon-war is an application that manages the teams participated in the hackathon event.

## Planning

### Specs
* Spec 1: User wants to visit a page to see a list of all teams.
* Spec 2: User wants to click a team in the list to visit their profile page, which should include more details about them.
* Spec 3: User wants to have an option to visit an "About" page that explains what the event is, and what they do.
* Spec 4: User wants all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it.
* Spec 5: Administrator wants to add new teams to the event. (User authentication is not required).
* Spec 6: Administrator wants to edit user profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details.
* Spec 7: Administrator needs the option to delete a user, in case they leave the club or team.


## Future functionalities
  * Add a message board area, where team members may chat with each other.
  * Include an area called "announcements", "events", "games", etc. where users can post what events, matches, or meetings the club has planned.
  * User may filter the list of users by their particular role in the group, or some other information/category.
